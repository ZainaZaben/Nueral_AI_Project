# Nueral_AI_Project

Description:
This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to emulate the behavior of logical gates using artificial neural networks. Logical gates serve as the building blocks of modern computers, and this project aims to showcase their functionality through neural network emulation.

Methodology:

Gate Selection GUI: The application includes an intuitive GUI that allows users to choose between different logical gates, such as AND, NOT, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and OR gates.

Network Structure Definition: Upon selecting a gate, the system dynamically defines the neural network structure. Users can choose between a single-layer perceptron or a multi-layer network based on the complexity of the chosen logical gate.

Initialization of Weights and Biases: The system initializes weights and biases with random numbers to start the training process.

Activation Function Configuration: Users have the flexibility to choose the activation function for the layers of the neural network, allowing experimentation with different functions.

Training Algorithm: The backpropagation learning algorithm is employed for training the neural network. Gradient Descent is used as the training algorithm, ensuring effective weight adjustments during the learning process.

Performance Metric: The system supports the use of Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) as performance metrics during training, providing users with insights into the model's accuracy.

Graphical Representation: The GUI features a graph that visualizes the classification region after the training process. This allows users to observe how the neural network has learned to mimic the behavior of the selected logical gate.
